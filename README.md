# Snake-Game
Very basic website that let's you play snake with arrow keys (up, down, left, right).

Game is reset by refreshing the page and no pause function is implemented (yet).

Written with Pure JavaScript, CSS and HTML snake Game loop:

check for collisions (wall, food, snake itself) if collision with wall - end game if collision with food - add new node, spawn new food if collision with itself - end game advance snake (delete last node, add new) check if end of game (spawned enough food to end the game)
